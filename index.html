        <h3><b>Voice and Face Recognition Software</b></h3>
         Voice and face recognition is the way of the future.
            <br>Creating software to recognize your face and face to open a door or as a password enabling mechanism.</p>
        <h3><b>Diabetic prediction using data science</b></h3>
        The data was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (subgroup of Native Americans), and are females of ages 21 and above.

        We’ll be using Python and some of its popular data science related packages. First of all, we will import pandas to read our data from a CSV file and manipulate it for further use. We will also use numpy to convert out data into a format suitable to feed our classification model. We’ll use seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations.
        
        <h3><b>Natural Disasters Intensity Analysis and Classification using Artificial Intelligence</b></h3>
        we developed a multilayered deep convolutional neural network model that classifies the natural disaster and tells the intensity of disaster  of natural The model uses an integrated webcam to capture the video frame and the video frame is compared with the Pre-trained model and the type of disaster is identified and showcased on the OpenCV window.
